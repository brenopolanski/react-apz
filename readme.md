#### Disclaimer

While this guide attempts to be as simple as possible and tries to explain what's being done with the code,
it expects the reader to have at least some previous knowledge of ES6 (JavaScript class declaration, fat
arrow functions, enhanced object literals etc.) and a general picture of React concepts such as
JSX, lifecycle methods, component state and rendering. If you don't understand any of these concepts, the
guide might prove to be more difficult than expected and some parts of it might feel completely alien.
